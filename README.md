# Jargonaut

Jargonaut is an easy to use Chat Room application.

It's an XAPP so it's designed to work on all Linux distributions and all desktop environments.

Under the hood it uses IRC, though it makes no difference from a user point of view. It doesn't act as an IRC client, only a chat room application.
